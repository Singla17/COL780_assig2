# Template Tracking

In this work we do object detection using classical computer vision methods like Block-based matching (sliding-window method) and Lucas-Kanade Algorithm. The problem statement can be found [here](./Problem Statement.pdf) and detailed discussion can be found [here](./Report.pdf).

## Running Mode

Predict the bounding boxes using block-based matching (live_demo_2.py) or Pyramid-based LK Algorithm (live_demo.py)
